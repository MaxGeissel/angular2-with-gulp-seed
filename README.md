# angular2-with-gulp-seed
It's a seed project for using gulp build with angular2.

I used the quickstart projekt of angular.io. For more information check out: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

For the configuration of the gulp files I used the tutorial of Colin Eberhardt. Check out his article on http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/12/24/creating-an-angular-2-build.html for more information.
